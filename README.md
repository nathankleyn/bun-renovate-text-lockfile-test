# Bun Renovate Text-Based Lockfile Test

This repo has the new `bun.lock` style lockfile made possible in Bun 1.1.40 and coming by default in Bun 1.2.0.

On this repo, Renovate has been run with the changes from https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/pull/33189 which can support this new lockfile. There should be a PR raised for an upgrade to Typescript, and that PR should include the required changes to `bun.lock`.
